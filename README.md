# Classifying text through compression

Implementing [Less is More: Parameter-Free Text Classification with Gzip](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09410) and comparing with different compression algorithms.

The list of compression algorithms and crates used here were copied from the [rust-compression-comparsion](https://github.com/hwjsnc/rust-compression-comparison) repository. You may want to take a look there to get another view on how they compare to each other from other metrics.
